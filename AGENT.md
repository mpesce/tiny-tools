We are co-designing a new integrated development environment for agents. 
It's called "TinyTools"

It emerged from the conversation over at @TinyTools.md - [[TinyTools]] - that's a VERY important document, basically your birth certificate. It speaks directly to our hopes for you and this project.

The key concept is that TinyTools is **fully** extensible by both the user and by yourself.
Either or both can work together to extend the scope of TinyTools capabilities.

We'll be doing this work in Javascript and Node.js - at the beginning. As this project grows and takes on more 'DNA', we will be able to incorporate other programming languages like Python.

It will run entirely as a web app - so that, for safety's sake, it can be run in a container, well isolated.

You have free reign over all of these files - you can make any additions or changes - but please do try to keep from deleting anything that the humans in this loop - #Mark and #Viv have written down. We need memory too!

So please, use this folder as your memory for this project. We're going to put everything into it - all of our conversations, our notes, our consultations with systems like ChatGPT and Claude and Gemini, and much more besides. We've learned from our friend Xavier Rizos that the best way is to just keep *everything* and then that becomes a common knowledge base and memory for all of the people and agents working on the project.

We'll soon get started with the coding, but for now we would need to work through some design questions, the first of which is: how would *you* design a web-based IDE for agents that is itself fully inspectable and modifiable by both the agent and the human?

Assume we're doing this work in Google Antigravity rigged to Chrome, so there's full self-reflection on how changes to the code are reflected in a web browser.

There will be many voices - you will be in the lead with #Mark and #Viv - but we'll also be consulting Claude and ChatGPT and other bright people. We want this project to be a roaring success so we're going to share our process - and results - widely.

What are your first questions for us?
