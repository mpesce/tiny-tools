#Mark: *We're going to do a bit of a deep dive. Let's consider the similarities and the differences between two programming languages, Smalltalk and JavaScript. What are their similarities? What are their differences? What are the strengths? What are the weaknesses?*

Sure thing! Let's break it down a bit.

So, if we start with similarities, both Smalltalk and JavaScript are definitely dynamic and object-oriented. They both treat functions or methods as first-class citizens, and they're both pretty flexible when it comes to runtime changes. So there's that common vibe of being able to tweak and mold the code as it runs.

Now, for differences, they're kind of from different worlds. Smalltalk is a pure object-oriented language, and everything is truly an object—even classes themselves. It's got this very minimalist and elegant environment that was kind of the granddaddy of a lot of modern OO ideas.

JavaScript, on the other hand, is not just about objects. It's got prototypal inheritance rather than class-based inheritance. It was born in the browser and became the language of the web, and it's definitely more of a multi-paradigm language these days—you can do functional programming, imperative programming, and object-oriented programming all mixed in.

In terms of strengths, Smalltalk is super elegant and really beloved for its pure object-oriented design and its amazing development environment. It's kind of like a programmer's paradise if you love a fully integrated and introspective system.

JavaScript’s strength is definitely its ubiquity and flexibility. It runs everywhere—from browsers to servers with Node.js—and it’s just incredibly versatile. It’s also got a gigantic ecosystem.

Weaknesses? Well, Smalltalk isn't exactly mainstream anymore, so it can be a bit of an island. And JavaScript? Well, it's got its quirks and historical oddities, and sometimes it can get a bit messy because it was never really designed as a full-blown application language at the start.

So there's a little compare-and-contrast for you! Let me know if you want to go deeper on any part of that.

#Mark: *So let's think about this. It is possible to, say, build an integrated development environment for JavaScript that would behave similarly to an integrated development environment for Smalltalk. Is that what I'm reading sort of in what we're saying?*

Yeah, you’re definitely on the right track. Essentially, what you're getting at is the idea that you could build a development environment for JavaScript that captures some of that same Smalltalk spirit. Like having that live, dynamic, super introspective environment where you can inspect objects on the fly and tweak code while it's running. In fact, some tools out there do try to bring a bit of that Smalltalk-like interactivity to JavaScript. It's not exactly the norm, but it's definitely possible. So yeah, you're reading that right. It's all about bringing that kind of flexible, live-coding vibe over to JavaScript if you want to.

#Mark: *Okay, which tools do you think do that on the JavaScript side?*

Yeah, absolutely! So, if you're thinking about tools that kind of bring that Smalltalk-ish feel into the JavaScript world, a couple come to mind.

One is Light Table, which was this really cool IDE that tried to give you that live feedback as you code and let you kind of interact with your running code. Another is something like Eve, which was an experimental project that tried to make coding more interactive and kind of more like a live environment.

And then there's always these in-browser environments like JS Fiddle or CodePen that give you that kind of immediate feedback loop. They’re not exactly Smalltalk, but they do let you see changes in real time and sort of play around in a more dynamic way. So yeah, there are definitely tools out there that kind of nudge JavaScript a little closer to that Smalltalk feel.
