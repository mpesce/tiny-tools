The first pass created by antigravity. 

It did create a web app that could modify itself. That part was well done. 

However, there’s nothing agentic about it. 

Any of the modifications need to be done by person or by an agent that is controlling web browser. 

That’s not what we want at all. 

What we want is a **fully and deeply integrated agent** so that the agent can make the necessary changes from *inside* its own development environment. 

I had thought we made that clear in the instructions. 
However, that appears not to be the case. 
So we need to go back and rethink the design.

We need to design TinyTools *from the ground* up to have an *agent inside* of it. 

The agent must be able to modify the code for the agent. 
Or any other part of the code. 
It can inspect any part of the agent - that is, itself - or any other part of the code.

This is an absolutely essential and necessary component of the design. 

Please implement this. 

If you need an example of an agentic design here is a link to the source code for OpenCode

https://github.com/sst/opencode

You can look through that to understand the principles of designing an agent.

Is this clear? 

Do you have any questions?
